    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to implement an algorithm that improves a given solution for the\n",
    "graph clustering problem via the max-flow problem. This is implemented in the `ImproveClustering` calass, which contains the actual improve method and makes use of the existing Edmonds-Karp implementation.\n",

    "This part was worked on by Malte Weber.\n",

    "# Implementation of the Stoer-Wagner Minimum Cut Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Stoer-Wagner algorithm is a polynomial-time algorithm that solves the minimum cut problem for\n",
    "undirected graphs. It is divided into phases, each of them computing a minimum $s$-$t$ cut for two\n",
    "vertices $s, t$ chosen by the algorithm. The graph is then shrunk by merging these two vertices, thus\n",
    "the remaining phases consider all the cuts where $s$ and $t$ are in the same subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This part was worked on by Johannes Lange.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Member Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "The `MinCutStoerWagner` class contains the following important member variables:\n",
    "- `G`: A pointer to the input graph.\n",
    "- `current_graph`: A reference to the current graph produced by the most recent phase.\n",
    "- `pq`: A bucket priority queue for the vertices of `current_graph`.\n",
    "- `node_mapping`: The mapping of the vertices in `G` to the vertices in `current_graph` produced by the shrinking in each phase.\n",
    "- `result`: A reference to the final result of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "In each phase, the vertices are selected based on their connection to $A$. Hence,\n",
    "the vertices of `current_graph` are stored in a\n",
    "`BucketPQ` such that each vertex $v$ is mapped to its cut $c$ with $A$, i. e. the cut between $A$ and $\\{ v \\}$.\n",
    "Since the priority queue implementation only allows min-element extraction, the algorithm stores the\n",
    "key-value pair $(-c, v)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The `MinCutStoerWagner` class contains the following important methods:\n",
    "- `void run()`: Executes all phases and saves the best solution.\n",
    "- `void fillQueue(node a)`: Fills the priority queue with the node keys for $A := \\{ a \\}$.\n",
    "- `void updateKeys(node u, Partition& A)`: Updates the keys of all vertices $v$ that are adjacent to $u$ and are yet to be considered, i. e. $v$ belongs to partition $0$ in $A$.\n",
    "- `Partition phase(node a)`: Executes the next phase on `current_graph`. At the end of the phase's execution, it shrinks `current_graph` and returns the cut-of-the-phase. This method also takes care of updating the `pq` and `node_mapping` member variables accordingly.\n",
